# **Featured Projects**
## **Computer Graphics Projects**
### **[Collection of Computer Graphics Implementation](https://github.com/puckblocker/Computer-Graphics-Project-Collection)**
This project implements different core principle of computer graphics. Some of which include: Camera and Viewport Generation, Ray Generation, Transforms, Intersection

### **[Great Bully Render Off](https://github.com/puckblocker/Great-Bully-RenderOff-Computer-Graphics-)**
Co-Developer. This render waws made in correlation to the Great Bully Render Off for Computer Graphics. This project implements perlin noise, artistic shading (cel and hue), lambertian diffuse, ideal specular, lighting (area, point, and directional), and tone mapping.

## **VR Projects**
### **[Dungeon Delving VR](https://github.com/TeeterHood/VR_Challenge3_mini)**
Lead Environment Designer. This project implemented physical embodiement through a real-world large stick that took the place of your hand and was reactive to the environment. Implemented Meta SDK for hand tracking. Use of animation to add enemies into the dungeon for better immersion. Created a dungeon environment to put the player into the world of an adventurer going through a dungeon.

### **[Art Museum VR](https://github.com/SChristenson24/G6_C2_VXR)**
Lead Programmer. Creation of teleportation based movement system, that does not use the pre-built teleportation feature. The environment throws the player into an art museum as a visitor that allows the user to teleport to view all the different artworks.

### **[Sunken City](https://github.com/loganswitzer01/VXR_Team_6_Challenge_1)**
Lead Environment Designer. This project demonstrates the basics of VR experiences, with the goal of placing the user into a stagnant environment. This environment throws the user into an acnient sunken city in a future where dinosaurs have re-emerged as an intelligent species and have taken over the world.

## **Game Projects**
### **[Gambler's Sin](https://github.com/puckblocker/GamblersSin)**
Solo Developer. Currently privated until complete to prevent unauthorized access. I have developed all of the art and animation and am currently working on programming. This is a 2D pixel game that uses purely custom assets made by myself. The game places the player as a gambler facing heavenly punishment in the form of the seven layers of Hell. He must descend the layers while using a custom-made luck system that determines all aspects of gameplay (weapons, perks, etc.), without losing himself to the temptations of eternal gambling.

### **[Immolation](https://github.com/Haywinkler05/Immolation)**
Lead UI Developer. In-Progress. This game was made in correlation to a horror-themed game jam. The game aims to throw the play into a hybrid 2D, 3D world where the player must obtain God's forgiveness while scavenging through limbo while being pursued by one of God's top angels.

## **Web & App Projects**
### **[CAVS UI](https://github.com/HBWright/CAVS-Group-2-HCI)**
Co-Developer. Implementation of a custom UI for the CAVS (Center For Advanced Vehicular Systems) car backseat to view cameras, system diagnostics, and other important information. The UI has three different profiles to view the UI from, along with four different views for each of the profiles to view different information. This was built for a physical UI that is made to be interacted with five physical buttons.

## **Misc. Projects**
### **[Custom Programming Language](https://github.com/puckblocker/Custom-Programming-Language)**
This C++ derived programming language was made with the skeleton provided by Derek Willis. The features include: mathematical functions (+,-,*,^, %, ++, --), comparison, relational, and looping.

### **[Shopping DataBase](https://github.com/Methods-And-Development-Group-18/Coding-Assignment)**
Co-Developer. Currently Privated. A small to medium sized database that had two tiers of access, Admin and Customer, that used python and SQL (Was a conceptual models with functioning areas, but was not made to be roled out). Each role had different priviledges fitting their role names. The database supported the adding/removal of different stock with reactivity to purchases. Customer role could add items to their cart and such that is expected with a shopping database. 

### **[To Do List](https://github.com/puckblocker/ToDoList)**
Solo Developer. A small web-based app that implements a simple to do list. This project serves as a demonstration of basic HTML, CSS, and TypeScript implementation.

### **[Neet/LeetCode Solution](https://github.com/puckblocker/NeetCode-LeetCode-Solutions)**
Solo Developer. This project is a compilation of my solutions to NeetCode and LeetCode problems. This serves as a demonstration of algorithm based solutions to problems.

### **[Player Visualization Research](https://github.com/GaVELab/Player-Vis-Survey)**
Researcher. Currently Privated. This is a repo that will eventually have it's findings published in a paper, once completed. This portion was made with the help of the Mississippi State University professor, Dr. T.J., and a fellow student researcher. This research was made with the goal of viewing how and why video game players gravitate towards creating visualizations for their needs, along with how this resembles professional visualizations.
